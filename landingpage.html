          <p>
            We are a group of people with decades of experience in growing and
            selling fruits. We know how they are grown. There are essential fruits
            which require a temperate climate, loamy soil that is rich in organic 
            matter apart from needing proper drainage and aeration facilities. 
            Aside from the growing method, pruning, pollination, protection and 
            fertilization, fruit quality is affected by environmental conditions, 
            the most notable of which include all macro and microclimatic elements 
            and soilÂ environment.
